Hey Internet!
Long time, no read.
It's been a long time since I posted here.
The last time I posted was when I was young. I am still young, but older by 2 years now.
I've gained a lot of life experiences now.
I wouldn't say that life has been easy. But what's easy?
What's the point of pursuing easy things? Only point, that they're easy.
That doesn't make the pursuing worthwhile to me.

## Life's a teacher
Ups and downs, and more ups and downs.
You can go and read all the books that there are to read but you won't actually understand the concept unless you do it.
Practical beats theory every freakin time.

**What's next?**
Take the next breath. That's what's next.
