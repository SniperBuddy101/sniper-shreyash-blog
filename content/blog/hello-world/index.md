Hello Guys!

This is my first blog post on this blog!

For the people who don't know me, I'm Shreyash, a Software Developer in his 20s learning and building Full Stack Mobile and Web Apps.

I have always been amazed by tech and the problems it could solve for the mankind.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

You might be curious on why I decided to create this blog, right?

The answer to that is very simple. I wanted to express myself and document various problems that I go through and solve. In the process, maybe teach something valuable to the world and learn something that I didn't know before from the cool people who'll read this ðŸ˜†.

After all these years, I felt a need of documentation.

Why? You may ask.

Again, it's very simple.

When I'll grow old, what memories will I have for that version?

I don't want to leave a blank slate for that Shreyash.

I want him to remember all the highs and lows which I'll face from this day onwards!

Wouldn't it be amazing!? 

Indeed, it will be. ðŸ’¯

Glad that you're a part of my journey.

Until next time. The next blog post.
